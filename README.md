# NFA
University Prolog and Common Lisp project that implements a regular languages compiler and NFA tester.

## Regular Expressions Compilation into Non-Deterministic Finite State Automatas
This project consist in two libraries (written in Prolog and Common Lisp) for regular expressions compilation into non-deterministic finite state automatas and for their testing.

## Guidelines
[202001 E1P NFA.pdf](https://github.com/DrTaxi98/NFA/blob/master/202001%20E1P%20NFA.pdf)

## Project Structure
Each of the two folders, [Prolog](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/tree/master/Prolog) and [Lisp](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/tree/master/Lisp), contain a file, respectively [nfa.pl](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Prolog/nfa.pl) and [nfa.lisp](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Lisp/nfa.lisp) (the two versions of this project), along with their respective README.txt file ([Prolog README.txt](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Prolog/README.txt) and [Lisp README.txt](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Lisp/README.txt)). Please see them for further information about how to use correctly the two code files.

### [Prolog](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/tree/master/Prolog)
The [nfa.pl](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Prolog/nfa.pl) file is a Prolog library for regular expressions compilation into non-deterministic finite state automatas and for their testing.
For further information, please see the [Prolog README.txt](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Prolog/README.txt) file.

### [Common Lisp](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/tree/master/Lisp)
The [nfa.lisp](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Lisp/nfa.lisp) file is a Common Lisp library for regular expressions compilation into non-deterministic finite state automatas and for their testing.
For further information, please see the [Lisp README.txt](https://github.com/AndreaTassi98/NFA/blob/master/Lisp/README.txt) file.

## Used Tools
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - Editor for both Prolog and Common Lisp versions of the project
* [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) - Prolog prompt for testing
* [LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com/) - Common Lisp prompt for testing
